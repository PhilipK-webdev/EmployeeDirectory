# Introduction: Home Assignment Employee Directory


For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.


## User Story

```
 As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
```

## Motivation

```
The last phase of the course is React. 
Trying to demonstrate the functionality of React, the Reusability and the collaboration between js and HTML. 

```
## Getting Started

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
